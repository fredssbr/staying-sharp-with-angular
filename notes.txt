ROUTES
    Angular routes allow us to map URLs to use templates so that every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it.
        use ngView
            tell Angular where to load in templates 
        load the ngRoute lib
            load the file script in the html
        import ngRoute module
            import in the angular module
        define route
